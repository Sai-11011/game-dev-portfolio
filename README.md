# NodeNomad Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my game development portfolio! I am currently undertaking a "7-Game Roadmap" to master game architecture, mechanics, and the Godot Engine. 

This repository serves as an archive of my completed minimum viable products (MVPs). My philosophy is simple: **"Done is better than perfect."**

## 🕹️ The Archive (Current Projects)

### 1. Tic Tac Toe
A classic logic puzzle built from scratch to cement web fundamentals before diving into game engines.
* **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Focus:** DOM manipulation and basic win-state logic.

### 2. Neon Pong
The "Hello World" of physics engines. A juiced-up arcade classic focusing on retro aesthetics and core engine mechanics.
* **Tech Stack:** Godot 4, GDScript.
* **Focus:** RigidBody physics, Collision Signals, and basic Game Loops.

### 3. GoBunny
An endless runner featuring procedural generation and persistent data management.
* **Tech Stack:** Godot 4, GDScript.
* **Focus:** * Procedural obstacle instancing and memory management (`queue_free`).
  * Encrypted Global Save System using dictionaries.
  * Audio Bus management for overlapping SFX (polyphony).
  * UI State Management (Pause, Game Over, Instant Restart).

## 🛠️ Upcoming on the Roadmap
Following my structured learning path, future projects will explore:
* Top-Down Arena Shooters (Vector Math & State Machines)
* Precision Platformers (TileMaps & RayCasting)
* Turn-Based RPGs (Custom Resources & Advanced UI)
